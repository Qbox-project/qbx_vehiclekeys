# qbx_vehiclekeys
An advanced customizable vehicle key system for the Qbox framework

# Features

## Backwards Compatibility with qb-vehiclekeys
All exports and events from qb-vehiclekeys will continue to work with qbx_vehiclekeys. However, we still recommend using the qbx_vehiclekey exports as they use less resources.

## General
- Players can obtain keys when entering a running vehicle (configurable)
- Vehicles can keep their engine running after exiting (configurable)
- World spawn vehicles have a random initial lock state (configurable)
- Exports to give/remove keys
- Vehicle lock status synced between clients
- Animations for all activities to increase immersion, including a special animation to play when toggling the engine!
- Players reconnecting will have the same keys that they had when they disconnected/crashed. The timeout for how long they can be disconnected and still get the same keys is configurable.

## Players Transfering Keys
- Players can give keys to the closest player or passengers in their vehicle via command
- Admins can also give keys
- Owners of vehicles always have keys to their own vehicles

## Shared Job Vehicles
- Jobs can share vehicles, letting emergency workers all have keys to emergency vehicles for example
- Autolock supported so that players don't need to remember to lock their vehicles when exiting (configurable)

## Highly Customizable
Apply config to all vehicles, or choose a specific vehicle type, class, category, or model to apply settings to. This allows for different minigame difficulties dependent on the vehicle, or exempt certain vehicles from hotwiring, etc.

## Criminal Actions

### Carjacking
Point a weapon at an NPC driver to force them to stop, put their hands up, exit the vehicle, and run away, giving you keys. Only weapons on the configurable allow list work for carjacking.

### Lockpicking
Use lockpicks with ox_lib skill minigames to unlock vehicle doors.

### Hotwiring
Use lockpicks when in the driver seat to get keys to the vehicle.

### Searching For Keys
Search for the keys when in the driver seat to get keys to the vehicle.

### Police Alerts
Alerts police when a vehicle is being broken into, or stolen.
- Lower chance to alert at night (configurable)
- cooldown to prevent spam (configurable)


## ðŸ”§ Lockpick Item Configuration (ox_inventory)
Add the following to your `ox_inventory/data/items.lua` to ensure both lockpick types work correctly:

```lua
['lockpick'] = {
        label = 'Lockpick',
        weight = 50,
        stack = true,
        close = true,
        client = {
            event = 'lockpicks:UseLockpick',
            args = false,  -- IMPORTANT: pass false (not nil) so we go down the normal path
        },
    },

    ['advancedlockpick'] = {
        label = 'Advanced Lockpick',
        weight = 50,
        stack = true,
        close = true,
        client = {
            event = 'lockpicks:UseLockpick',
            args = true,   -- Advanced path
        },
    },
```
